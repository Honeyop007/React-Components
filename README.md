- `description`: The description text for the card.

#### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Card({ title, description }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Card;
```

#### Usage Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Card from './components/Card';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Card title="Card 1" description="This is the first card." />
      <Card title="Card 2" description="This is the second card." />
      <Card title="Card 3" description="This is the third card." />
